## Project Overview
Welcome to my full stack capstone project for Nashville Software School!!

La Biblioteca is my version of one of my favorite websites, GoodReads. I enjoy so much about GoodReads, but, for me, there's one thing missing: the ability to rate finished books with full and half star ratings. For La Biblioteca users, the restraint of only rating books with full stars is gone, because let's be honest, some books are 4.5 stars and not 5 stars nor are they 4 stars. Now, fair ratings are giving AND La Biblioteca users still enjoy GoodReads features like placing books onto "Want to Read", "Currently Reading", and "Read" shelves, leaving a review of a read book, perusing other user's reviews, reacting to reviews and using the search bar to find either a book or an author.
